# lab14_map
python html map project

# Description
Main module is capable of making web map with pointed nearest to you locations where were films shot in a specific year.
It also has a layer of most recent films locations

Usually it takes up to 6 minutes to create a map, due to limit of geopy API

In module I use file locations_24.list, which is a smaller version of original locations.list file, this is for the convenience of user, module works fine with both.
